- [ ] PR is linked to the corresponding user story
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are met

- [ ] Deviations from the acceptance criteria and design are agreed with the PO and documented.
- [ ] No debug or dead code

- [ ] All non-functional requirements are met
- [ ] If possible, [the test configuration](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-charts/blob/main/charts/zitadel/test/installation/config_test.go) is adjusted so acceptance tests cover my changes
